# Seattle_Climate_Prediction
Climate prediction (not weather prediction) is crucial for federal and local governments, farmers,
and tourist agencies in order to plan well in advance for any decision-making or get ready for any 
likely weather/climate extremes. There are many factors contributing to climate prediction. 
In this project, I selected my city, Seattle, where many people (outside WA state) think 
"it's always rainy in Seattle". 

I downloaded Seattle airport station data for the last three years. As shown in the first figure,
the precipitation amount greatly reduces from winter to summer, and vice versa. It is also seen 
that precipitation and temperature are inversely associated. The second figure shows that 
temperature can be used as a predictor for precipitation via a linear regression showing a 
correlation coefficient of 0.9. 

In the future, I plan to use data for a longer period (e.g. 20 years), and for more climate stations. 
In addition, I will account for other contributing factors (e.g. wind, El-Nino, Atmospheric Rivers, ...) 
via a multiple regression and other Machine Learning techniques. All these will help to provide a more 
accurate prediction.
